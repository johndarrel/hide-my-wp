== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Does this plugin work on WP Multisite? =

Yes, the plugin works on WP Multisite and you will configure it for the entire network.

= Is Hide My WP Ghost working on Nginx Server? =

Yes, the plugin works on Nginx Server and you will be guided for the redirects and nginx.conf settings.

The plugin also works with Apache, IIS and LiteSpeed servers

= My website theme is not loading correctly after I change the paths. What should I do? =

This issue is most likely from setting the rewrite rules.

1. Make sure you purge the cache if you have cache plugins after you save the Hide My WP Ghost settings.
2. In case the .htaccess (for apache) or nginx.conf (for Nginx) or web.config (for IIS) are not writable you need to add the rewrites manually.
3. If you have Nginx server make sure you reload the Nginx after you save the settings.
4. If the theme is still not loading okay, contact us and we can set up the plugin for you for free.

= I forgot the custom login and admin URLs. What now? =

Don't panic.

You can still access your site with the secure parameter
http://domainname/wp-login.php?hmw_disable=[your_code]

= Locked out of my site!  I set the plugin, and after I logged out I couldn't get back in =

Rename the plugin directory /wp-content/plugins/hide-my-wp so that the plugins won't hide the wp-login.php path anymore

Login using http://domainname/wp-login.php and activate the plugin again.

Make sure you remember the secure parameter and it will be much easier.

= Does Hide My WP Ghost work for WordPress.com website? =

Because of the Jetpack security in WordPress.com website, Hide My WP Ghost can't change the admin and login paths.

If you already activated Hide My Wp on WordPress.com, remove the directory /wp-content/plugins/hide-my-wp to disable the plugin.

= Will this plugin work if I don't have custom permalinks on my site? =

No. You need to have custom permalinks set to 'on' in Settings > Permalinks.

You will get a notification in the Settings page if something is not setup right.


= What do I need to do before I deactivate the plugin? =

It's better to switch to Default Mode in Settings > Hide My WP.

If you don't, the plugin will automatically change your site back to the safe URLs and it will tell you what to do if you don't have write permission for the config files

= How to Hide Your Site From WordPress Theme Detectors? =

Changing the common WordPress paths will not guarantee that the WordPress CMS is completely hidden.

= Is this plugin enough to protect my website from all hackers? =

The Free version of Hide My WP Ghost hides the wp-admin and wp-login as described but will not protect you from all hacker attacks.


Hide My WP Ghost hides all the common paths and patterns used but bots to detect that you are using WordPress.

We also recommend you to install Premium Themes and Plugins and not just any WordPress plugin because the free plugins are usually made by beginners and they don't have security knowledge.
