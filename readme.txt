Security through obscurity is one of the best solutions against hacker bots and one of the best ways to protect vulnerable plugins and themes.

Over 90,000 hacking attacks per minute strike WordPress sites and WordPress hosting around the world, hitting not only large corporate websites packed with sensitive data, but also sites belonging to small businesses, independent entrepreneurs, and individuals running personal blogs.

Security of WordPress sites typically tops the list of concerns for new and experienced website owners alike.

For owners of WordPress sites, statistics like that one raises particular worries about the security not just of individual WordPress sites, but of WordPress itself.

= Locked out of my site!  I set the plugin, and after I logged out I couldn't get back in =

Rename the plugin directory /wp-content/plugins/hide-my-wp so that the plugins won't hide the wp-login.php path anymore

Login using http://domainname/wp-login.php and activate the plugin again.

Make sure you remember the secure parameter and it will be much easier.

= Does Hide My WP Ghost work for WordPress.com website? =

Because of the Jetpack security in WordPress.com website, Hide My WP Ghost can't change the admin and login paths.

If you already activated Hide My Wp on WordPress.com, remove the directory /wp-content/plugins/hide-my-wp to disable the plugin.

= Will this plugin work if I don't have custom permalinks on my site? =

No. You need to have custom permalinks set to 'on' in Settings > Permalinks.

You will get a notification in the Settings page if something is not setup right.


= What do I need to do before I deactivate the plugin? =

It's better to switch to Default Mode in Settings > Hide My WP.

If you don't, the plugin will automatically change your site back to the safe URLs and it will tell you what to do if you don't have write permission for the config files

= Is this plugin enough to protect my website from all hackers? =

The Free version of Hide My WP Ghost hides the wp-admin and wp-login as described but will not protect you from all hacker attacks.


Hide My WP Ghost hides all the common paths and patterns used but bots to detect that you are using WordPress.

We also recommend you to install Premium Themes and Plugins and not just any WordPress plugin because the free plugins are usually made by beginners and they don't have security knowledge.
